House Price Prediction Project
Project Overview:

The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sale prices of residential properties. This project involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing a dataset containing various features related to houses, such as their size, location, number of bedrooms, age, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to build a model that can assist real estate professionals, potential buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions based on estimated property values.

Project Objectives:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a comprehensive dataset from reliable sources, such as real estate listings, government property records, and other publicly available data.
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
Feature Engineering:

Identify and create relevant features that can improve the predictive power of the model. This may include creating new variables, such as price per square foot, age of the property, or proximity to amenities.
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features to prepare the data for model training.
Model Selection and Training:

Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of different models.
Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the selected model.
Analyze the residuals and diagnose any potential issues with the model's predictions.
Deployment and Visualization:

Deploy the final model using a suitable platform or framework, such as Flask or Django, to create a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices.
Develop interactive visualizations and dashboards to present the model's predictions and insights in an easily understandable format.
Implement features that allow users to input property details and obtain estimated prices based on the trained model.
